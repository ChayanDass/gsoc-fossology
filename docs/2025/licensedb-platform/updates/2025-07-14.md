# Week 7

*(July 14, 2025 â€“ July 21, 2025)*

## Meeting 1

**Date:** July 17, 2025

**Status:** Did not happen.

## Updates

- I was occupied with my `C4GT` evaluation, so I couldn't work as planned during this week.
- However, I managed to create a pull request for the frontend to add a feature for refreshing tokens. This enhancement will improve the authentication flow by ensuring tokens are updated seamlessly.

## Planning for Next Week

- I have not planned any specific tasks for the next week as I will be traveling and relocating my belongings from one hostel to another. This transition will likely take up most of my time.
