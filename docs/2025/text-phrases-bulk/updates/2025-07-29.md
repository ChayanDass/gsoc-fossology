## Summary

- Limited updates were shared this week from my side as I continued to explore the implementation of the MONKBULK agent implementation. 
- To accelerate the progress, mentors recommended me to leverage the existing MONK agent codebase as a foundation for the implementation of the new agent's development.

## Progress

- Transitioned focus from MONKBULK to the MONK agent, which presents a more suitable architectural baseline for the Kotoba agent's implementation.
- Implementation Planning: 
    - Identify core components requiring modification.
    - Outline necessary functional adaptations
    - Develop initial rodmap for the codebase transformation. 

## Next Steps

- Create a prototype by duplicating and modifying the MONK agent codebase.
- Begin implementiong the founational changes to align with the requirements of the new Kotoba agent.
