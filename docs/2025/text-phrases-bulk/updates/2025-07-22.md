## Summary

- Presented findings from the analysis of the MONKBULK agent to mentors, highlighting its relevance to the new agent's development. 
- Implementation feedback was deferred since the actual development of the new agent had not yet start by me. 

## Progress

- Began the implementation phase of the new agent, tentatively name "Kotoba" (derived from the Japanese word "Kotoba" which means word). The naming of this new agent might be revised in the future.
- I dedicated most of this week's time to understand the interaction between scheduler and agent within the FOSSology codebase, which is critical for the development of this new agent.
