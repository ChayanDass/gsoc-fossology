# Week 09 Meetings and Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 9

*(August 11, 2025 - August 16, 2025)*

### Docker Integration

This weekâ€™s focus was on **Docker integration**. Since ORT relies on containerized workflows for reproducibility, I worked on bringing the Nomos release into the ORT Docker image. The idea was to ensure that anyone using ORT inside Docker can seamlessly access the Nomos scanner without manual setup.  

I modified the Dockerfile to fetch the latest Nomos GitHub release and placed the binary in the correct path. After rebuilding the image, I ran a sample scan to confirm that the Nomos plugin was detected and executed successfully.  

### Example Change (Dockerfile)

```dockerfile
RUN wget -q https://github.com/.../FOSSology-nomos \
    -O /opt/ort/bin/FOSSology-nomos \
    && chmod +x /opt/ort/bin/FOSSology-nomos
```

### Progress

- Modified the ORT Dockerfile to include the Nomos GitHub release.  
- Built a fresh ORT Docker image with the integration.  
- Ran test scans to validate that Nomos works inside Docker.

### Next Steps

- Share Docker integration results with mentors for feedback.  
- Begin preparing for final project wrap-up and documentation.
