# Week 08 Meetings and Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 8

*(August 4, 2025)*

### Attendees

- [Prakash Mishra](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

### Discussion

- The main focus this week was on **plugin refactoring** to enhance the license detection output by including **line numbers**.
- During a deep dive into the **NOMOS agent code**, especially the JSON output handling, I discovered that the `-S` flag (used together with `-J`) provides **byte offsets**. These offsets can then be translated into **line numbers**, solving the issue of missing positional information in license results.
- Implemented and tested this approach in the NOMOS plugin integration for ORT.
- To illustrate the improvement, I captured **before vs. after** screenshots of the scan results:
  
  - **Before (without line numbers):**  
    ![Nomos Result Before](/img/oss-review-toolkit/scan-result-before.png)

  - **After (with line numbers):**  
    ![Nomos Result After](/img/oss-review-toolkit/scan-result-line.png)

- Additionally, I began exploring **Docker basics** to prepare for future containerized workflows and testing setups.

### Progress

- Refactored the NOMOS plugin to make use of the `-S` flag, enabling byte offset extraction along with JSON output.
- Implemented logic to **map byte offsets to line numbers**, thereby improving the quality and usability of license findings.
- Tested the implementation locally and validated results against multiple scan samples.
- Prepared comparison screenshots (before vs after) to clearly demonstrate the improvement in scan results.
- Looked into **Docker fundamentals**, including image building and workflow basics, to strengthen understanding for upcoming integration tasks.

### Next Steps

- Finalize the **line number integration** in the NOMOS plugin and clean up the implementation for maintainability.
- Continue addressing ongoing **PR feedback** from ORT maintainers to align with ORT plugin standards.
- Begin working on a **Docker-based test setup** to streamline reproducibility and CI integration.
