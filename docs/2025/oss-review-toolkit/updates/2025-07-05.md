# Week 05 Meetings and Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 5

*(June 30, 2025)*

### Attendees

- [Prakash Mishra](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

### Discussion

- Had a sync discussion with my mentor regarding further improvements to the NOMOS scanner plugin in ORT.
- We specifically discussed optimizing resource usage, particularly how NOMOS allows setting the number of CPUs for scanning.
- It was suggested to explore this option and consider adding it to the plugin configuration for better flexibility and control.
- Also informed my mentor that I will be on **exam leave for the next two weeks (Week 6 & Week 7)**, during which I will have limited availability but will try to stay loosely connected with the project.

### Progress

- Continued development and refinement of the NOMOS plugin integration in ORT.
- Refactored parts of the codebase to improve structure and resolve existing issues from earlier feedback.
- Successfully implemented support for configuring the number of CPUs used by NOMOS.
- Default is set to `2`, but it can be customized via the scannerâ€™s configuration file.
- This change improves scan performance tuning and offers better control over resource usage during analysis.

### Next Steps

- Improve error handling related to NOMOS execution and CPU configuration.
- Reach out to the **OSS maintainer** to discuss how NOMOS should be released and how to structure its Docker image.
