# Week 07 Meetings and Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 7

*(July 28, 2025)*

### Attendees

- [Prakash Mishra](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

### Discussion

- This week, I focused on preparing and testing the **NOMOS release**.
- I **demonstrated** a local test run of the **release** setup using GitHub Actions on my forked repository.
Here’s a screenshot of the release with uploaded assets:

- Received feedback on refining the release workflow to match FOSSology’s standards and improve automation robustness.
- Meanwhile, **ORT maintainers started reviewing the pull request** for the NOMOS plugin integration and provided valuable feedback on code structure, naming conventions, and output handling.
- Discussed the review points with my mentor and began incorporating those changes step by step.

### Progress

- Developed and tested a working **GitHub Actions release workflow** for NOMOS in my personal fork.
- Integrated `build`, `tag`, and `upload` steps using a static binary approach as advised by mentors and ORT maintainers.
- Took feedback on **naming conventions** (e.g., renaming the release artifact to `FOSSology-nomossa`) and started refining the release process accordingly.
- Began addressing the **review comments** on the NOMOS scanner plugin PR in the ORT repository:
  - Refactored and simplified parts of the implementation based on feedback from ORT maintainers.
  - Improved license result processing: previously, NOMOS-detected licenses were used directly, but now these are **re-validated and mapped using ORT's SPDX utility functions** to ensure standardized and accurate SPDX identifiers in the scan results.
  - Removed unnecessary or redundant code sections to make the plugin cleaner and easier to maintain.
  - Addressed failing CI test cases step by step as part of making the PR merge-ready.
  - Improved naming and structure to better follow ORT’s plugin conventions.

### Next Steps

- Finalize the GitHub Actions release workflow and prepare a clean PR for upstream FOSSology.
- Continue resolving review feedback on the ORT PR and aim for approval/merge.
- Coordinate with both FOSSology and ORT maintainers for aligning release versions and tags.
