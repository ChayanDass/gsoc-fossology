# Week 06 Meetings and Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 6

*(July 21, 2025)*

### Attendees

- [Prakash Mishra](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

### Discussion

- I was on exam leave for two weeks (July 7th–19th) and resumed regular project activity afterward.
- Had a sync meeting with my mentor to review ongoing tasks and next steps.
- Discussed feedback received from ORT maintainers regarding the NOMOS plugin — it was suggested to use a **static release of NOMOS** for easier integration and reproducibility.
- Mentor recommended learning about **CI/CD pipelines**, particularly **GitHub Actions** and how to publish **GitHub Releases** to support NOMOS distribution.
- I also informed the mentor that I have opened a **pull request** for my ongoing work in **ORT Repository**.

### Progress

- During the week, some **CI/CD checks failed** on the ORT side after pushing changes.
- Worked on resolving CI/CD issues encountered in the ORT repository.
- Made code adjustments based on error messages and feedback from the maintainers.
- Started learning about **GitHub Actions workflows** and how to automate **releases** for NOMOS.

### Next Steps

- Finalize the static NOMOS release setup for CI consumption.
- Set up an initial GitHub Actions workflow for building and releasing NOMOS binaries.
- Continue improving the NOMOS plugin's stability based on CI feedback.
