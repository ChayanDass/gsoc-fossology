# Week 9

*(July 24, 2025 - July 30, 2025)*

## Overview

This week was focused on integrating the **core logic of Atarashi** into **FOSSology**. The work involved interacting with various components such as the Atarashi wrapper, FOSSology’s agent structure, and the backend database handling mechanisms.

---

## Development Progress

* Worked on the **Atarashi wrapper for FOSSology**:
  * Integrated the core classification logic.
  * Ensured agent-specific parameters were properly parsed and passed.
* Explored and understood the relevant **database tables** where Atarashi’s output will be stored.
* Investigated and adapted existing **database handler functionalities** to support Atarashi's results.

---

## Meeting

* I was **unable to attend the weekly sync meeting** this week due to a **doctor's appointment at AIIMS Delhi**.
  * Underwent a scheduled **endoscopy** on July 30.
  * Had a follow-up **consultation** on July 31.

---

## Status

* Significant progress made in aligning Atarashi’s logic with FOSSology’s agent framework.
* Database integration groundwork laid out, enabling result persistence in future iterations.
* Missed the team meeting, but will catch up via notes or mentor communication.

---

## Next Steps

* Finalize the database integration and test the complete pipeline.
* Work on the UI form for triggering Atarashi with agent/similarity options.
* Sync up with mentors to align on next milestones and get feedback on current progress.
