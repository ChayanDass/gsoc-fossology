# Week 10

*(July 31, 2025 - August 06, 2025)*

## Overview

This week marked a significant milestone in the project — the **core integration of the Atarashi agent into FOSSology** was successfully completed and tested. The Atarashi binary is now being **built as part of the FOSSology build process** and can be **invoked as a standalone agent** within the framework.

---

## Development Progress

* **Successfully integrated the Atarashi agent** into the FOSSology system.
  * The agent binary is now **compiled during FOSSology's build**.
  * It executes correctly with the input data and logs outputs as expected.

* Validated the **end-to-end pipeline** from scheduling to execution.

---

## Meeting

* Had a detailed discussion with the mentors regarding the agent configuration approach.
* **Key decision**:
  * The user will not configure sub-agents (e.g., tfidf, Ngram) from the Atarashi binary.
  * The user will only select Atarashi as a license scanner in FOSSology.
  * Agents inside of atarashi will be controlled via an `atarashi.conf` file within the agent’s directory.
* Direction agreed upon: **Atarashi will be treated as a singular agent**, and the best-performing internal logic will be selected automatically.

---

## Status

* Core agent integration complete.
* Binary built with FOSSology.
* Basic execution tested successfully.
* Alignment achieved with mentors on configuration flow.

---

## Next Steps

* Refactor Atarashi as a **single-agent interface** with no user-exposed options.
* Move agent/similarity selection logic into `atarashi.conf`.
* Implement logic to **select the best-performing agent internally by default**.
* Begin working on UI integration to expose Atarashi agent selection in a clean and simple way.
