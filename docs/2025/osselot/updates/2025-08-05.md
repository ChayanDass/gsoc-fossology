**Discussion Points**

**Functionalities Overview**

FOSSology Dump Export — Uses MD5 hashes of files and filenames to store license clearing data, copyright cleanup, and configuration info in a JSON.

FOSSology Dump Import — Reads the JSON, matches MD5 hashes with uploaded files, and applies the corresponding clearing decisions.

**Current Problem**

* Works only if:

  * Upload name and version are identical.
  * Both export and import instances are on the **same commit/version**.
* Goal:

  * Make import/export work across **any version** of the upload on **any instance** with the required agents.

**Other Topics Discussed**

* PR feedback:
  * Add proper logging mechainism to ScanCode agent.
  * Remove global variables from `common-sysconfig` and move them to agent-specific config.

## Updates

* Multiprocessing implementation for ScanCode agent submitted.
* Began exploring FOSSology Dump limitations and potential fixes.
* Identified two improvements: structured logging and configuration refactoring.

## Plan for Next Week

Continue investigation into FOSSology Dump issues by running small-scale tests and fix the pr.
