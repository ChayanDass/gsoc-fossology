# Week 10

*(August 6, 2025 – August 12, 2025)*

## Meetings

### Meeting 10.1

*(August 7, 2025)*

**Attendees**

* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)

**Discussion Points**

**FOSSology Dump Enhancement Research**

* **Issue 1** — Works only if upload name and version are identical.

  * **Proposed Solution:** Remove strict dependency on name/version match and use **content hash (MD5/SHA1)** for file identification during import.

* **Issue 2** — Works only if both export and import instances are on the same commit/version.

  * **Proposed Solution:** Instead of aborting the entire import when an agent’s data is incompatible, **log a warning** and continue processing remaining data.

**Other Topics Discussed**

* PR review feedback for the **ScanCode agent** reiterated:
  1. Implement proper logging.
  2. Move global variables from `common-sysconfig` into the agent-specific config file.


### Meeting 10.2

*(August 12, 2025)*

**Attendees**

* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
* [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)

**Discussion Points**

* Reported **completion of fix for Issue 1** — implemented **hash-based file matching** for import.
* Discussed **possible approaches for Issue 2**

## Updates

* **FOSSology Dump Enhancement**

  * Fixed **Issue 1**: Now uses content hashes for matching files across instances, removing strict name/version dependency.
  * Began work on **Issue 2**, identified challenges, and discussed logging-based fallback handling.
  * Fixed some bugs in the previous pr as addressed by my mentor.

## Plan for Next Week

1. Apply PR feedback changes to the ScanCode agent:
   * Add structured logging.
   * Refactor configuration handling.
3. Working on the idea to have reuse functionality through REST API.
