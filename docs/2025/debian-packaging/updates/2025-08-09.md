# Week 4

## Debian Packaging Progress

This week focused on resolving critical infrastructure issues and advancing the Fossology integration process:

### **Critical Issue Resolved: Symfony Autoloader**

- **Problem**: Fossology installation failed with ContainerBuilder class not found error
- **Root Cause**: Broken autoloader path in our custom php-symfony-dependency-injection package
- **Solution**: Fixed autoloader installation mapping and added PSR namespace support
- **Impact**: Fossology can now access all required Symfony classes

### **Build Infrastructure Completed**

- **Container Environment**: Moved project to clean container for isolated builds
- **Source Packaging**: Fixed dpkg-source symlink conflicts - packages now build successfully
- **All 29 PHP Dependencies**: Successfully built, installed, and verified working

### **Fossology Integration Progress**

- **22/24 Fossology packages**: Successfully installed and configured
- **Build Process**: Reaches 85% completion (17% of compile phase)
- **Core Components**: fossology-common, fossology-scheduler, and analysis agents working

## Technical Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed PHP autoloader path mapping** - Corrected file installation from directory structure to proper file location
2. **Enhanced autoloader functionality** - Added support for both Symfony and PSR namespaces
3. **Resolved build conflicts** - Eliminated symlink issues preventing source package creation
4. **Streamlined container workflow** - Clean build environment without permission conflicts

## Meeting 1

**Date:** Aug 5, 2025

Discussed the critical Symfony autoloader issue. We reviewed the container environment setup and discussed best practices for isolated builds.

---

## Meeting 2

**Date:** Aug 7, 2025

A technical review meeting focused on the build infrastructure improvements and Fossology integration progress. We discussed the successful resolution of symlink conflicts and the mentor provided feedback on the container workflow. We also reviewed the current build completion status and planned next steps for the remaining 2 packages.

## Next Steps

- **Complete the remaining 2 Fossology packages** to achieve 100% installation success
- **Resolve any remaining build issues** in the compile phase
- **Begin comprehensive testing** of the fully integrated Fossology system
- **Document the complete build and installation process** for future maintainers

---

## Planning for Week 5

- Finalize all Fossology package installations and configurations
- Conduct thorough testing of the complete system
- Begin preparation for the final evaluation phase
- Create comprehensive documentation of the entire packaging workflow
