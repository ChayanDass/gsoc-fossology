# Week 5

## Debian Packaging Progress

This week focused on resolving critical autoloader and configuration issues, making FOSSology fully self-contained and ready for Salsa deployment.

### **Key Problems Solved**

#### **1. Autoloader Integration**

- **Issue**: Web interface failed due to missing Composer autoloader in Debian environment
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive PSR-4 autoloader in php-psr-log package

#### **2. Configuration Automation**

- **Issue**: Manual configuration files required after installation
- **Solution**: Integrated config generation into package build process

#### **3. Database Setup**

- **Issue**: Manual PostgreSQL setup required
- **Solution**: Automated database creation and user setup in postinst script

## Technical Implementation

### **PSR Log Package (1.1.4-1.2)**

- Added FOSSology autoloader support
- Handles PSR libraries, FOSSology classes, case sensitivity

### **FOSSology Package**

- Enhanced fossology.conf.in with all required sections
- Enhanced postinst script for automated setup
- Added critical autoloader fixes via patches

## Current Status

### **✅ Fully Functional**

- Login system working (fossy/fossy)
- Browse module accessible
- Upload and admin modules configured
- All configuration automated

### **✅ Production Ready**

- Clean build process
- No manual intervention required
- Professional packaging standards

## Result

**FOSSology now builds and installs automatically without any manual steps.** Ready for Salsa deployment and production use.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed a manually-configured system into a fully automated, self-contained Debian package.
