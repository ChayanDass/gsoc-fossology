# Week 7: Meeting Summary and Activities  
**Date:** July 15, 2025  

## Attendees  
- Devanshi Sachan   
- Shaheem Azmal M MD  
- Amrit Verma  
- Gaurav Mishra
- Kaushlendra Pratap  
- Dearsh Oberoi 
- Tiyasa Kundu   

## Discussion Points  
- Discussed the structure of the “Schedule an Analysis” page, focusing on which analysis types are most commonly used and should be highlighted, versus those that are less frequently needed and could be deprioritized or hidden behind progressive disclosure.  
- Clarified which sections should support multi-select interactions and where limitations should apply, including handling of disabled states based on user input, dependencies, or system logic.  

## Activities Completed  
- Documented all components related to the Secondary Navigation Bar and Search Page in the design system, detailing usage guidelines, responsive behavior, and interaction states to ensure consistency across implementations.  
- Designed the first draft of the “Schedule an Analysis” page layout, outlining the structure and initial flow based on common user actions.  
- Designed all foundational components required for this page-such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, accordions, and supporting UI elements-to be reused and adapted as needed.  

## Next Steps  
- Begin analyzing the “Show Jobs” page and the Data Table component existing implementations, identify usability issues, and start designing out more streamlined, scalable alternatives.  
- Review other pages within FOSSology to identify those that share structural or functional similarities with “Schedule an Analysis.” This will help streamline the design process by reusing or adapting existing components where possible.
