## Discussion Points  
- Reviewed the final versions of the "Show Jobs" and "Report Configuration" pages, deciding whether they require any last refinements or are ready to proceed to development.

- Evaluated the hierarchy, relevance, and placement of folder and file names on the current page, and considered whether their visibility should be adjusted.  

## Activities Completed

- Added all new components from the "Report Configuration" and "Show Jobs" pages to the design system, documenting usage rules, responsive behavior, and state variations.

## Next Steps  
- Finalize the "Patent Relevant Browser" page design and share it for review and feedback.  
- Begin redesign of the "License Browser" page, starting with analysis to identify usability issues, layout inefficiencies, and opportunities for component reuse.
