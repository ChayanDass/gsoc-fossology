# Week 8: Meeting Summary and Activities  
**Date:** July 23, 2025  

## Attendees  
- Devanshi Sachan   
- Shaheem Azmal M MD  
- Kaushlendra Pratap  
- Tiyasa Kundu  

## Discussion Points  
- Discussed the “Upload a New File” page and its close relationship with the “Schedule an Analysis” page. Since certain analyses may already be run during file upload, we talked about how that should affect what options are available, disabling already-run analysis types in the scheduling flow. Clarified what kind of logic and dependency handling should exist between the two pages.  
- Revisited how much information should remain visible upfront on both pages, and how to reduce visual clutter. Also discussed how the reuse information popup could be improved making it clearer, more informative, and less interruptive to the user flow.  

## Activities Completed  
- Finalized the design of the “Schedule an Analysis” page with a stronger layout hierarchy grouping related sections and using accordions to hide less frequently used options, helping reduce cognitive load.  
- Began documenting these components and their variations in the design system, including usage guidelines, behavior rules, and state definitions.  
- Designed the first version of the “Upload a New File” page, reusing existing design patterns and components for consistency. Also started exploring improvements to the popup experience.  

## Next Steps  
- Begin designing the “Export Lists” page, which shares layout and interaction patterns with previously designed pages, focusing on reuse and consistency.  
- Continue expanding the design system documentation with detailed explanations of how and when to use specific components, including edge cases and responsive behavior.  
- Start early exploration of two upcoming pages, “Show Jobs" and "Report Configuration." Revisit pain points, component reuse opportunities, and areas that could benefit from better layout or interaction logic.
